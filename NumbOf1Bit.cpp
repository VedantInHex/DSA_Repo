/*Given a positive integer n, write a function that returns the number of set bits in its binary representation (also known as the Hamming weight).



Example 1:

Input: n = 11

Output: 3

Explanation:

The input binary string 1011 has a total of three set bits.

this code does not work beacause it is in a Method .though it can be used directly in a program by calling it */
